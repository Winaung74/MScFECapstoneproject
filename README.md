It contains python sample code, that demonstrates swing trading using a combination of volatility analysis with GARCH model for S&P 500 or other target stock and reinforcement machine learning
                                                            
      Machine Learning Codes -  This module has one subfolder name Stock Data, which has historical stock prices 
      in excel format and 4 python code files with output png files.
      
      Garch Model  - This module has two files one with 365 days S&P 500 and 30 days S&P 500 summary statistical
      and volatility data with output diagrams. Both files could open in ipython notebook environments and pdf files
      for output and codes to overview.
      
The project has been developed in Mac OS in Python 3.6 environment
